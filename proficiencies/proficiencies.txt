Agriculture: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Int    Check Mod: 0\nThe character has a knowledge of the basics\nof farming. This includes planting, harvesting, storing crops,\ntending animals, butchering, and other typical farming\nchores.
Ancient History: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Int    Check Mod: -1\nThe character has learned the legends,\nlore, and history of some ancient time and place. The knowledge\nmust be specific, just as a historian would specialize\ntoday in the English Middle Ages, the Italian Renaissance, or\nthe Roman Republic before Caesar. (The DM either can have\nancient periods in mind for his game or can allow the players\nto name and designate them.) Thus, a player character could\nknow details about the Age of Thorac Dragonking or the Time\nof the Sea-Raiders or whatever else was available.\n\nThe knowledge acquired gives the character familiarity\nwith the principal legends, historical events, characters, locations,\nbattles, breakthroughs (scientific, cultural, and magical),\nunsolved mysteries, crafts, and oddities of the time. The character\nmust roll a proficiency check to identify places or things\nhe encounters from that age. For example, Rath knows quite\na bit about the Coming of the Trolls, a particularly dark period\nof dwarven history. Moving through some deep caverns, he\nand his companions stumble across an ancient portal, sealed\nfor untold ages. Studying the handiwork, he realizes (rolls a\nsuccessful proficiency check) that it bears several seals similar\nto those he has seen on "banned" portals from the time of\n\nAngnar, doorways to the legendary realm of Trolhel.
Animal Handling: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Wis    Check Mod: -1 \nProficiency in this area enables a character\nto exercise a greater-than-normal degree of control over\npack animals and beasts of burden. A successful proficiency\ncheck indicates that the character has succeeded in calming\nan excited or agitated animal; in contrast, a character without\nthis proficiency has only a 20% chance of succeeding in the\nattempt.
Animal Lore: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Int    Check Mod: 0\nThis proficiency enables a character to\nobserve the actions or habitat of an animal and interpret what\nis going on. Actions can show how dangerous the creature is,\nwhether it is hungry, protecting its young, or defending a\nnearby den. Furthermore, careful observation of signs and\nbehaviors can even indicate the location of a water hole, animal\nherd, predator, or impending danger, such as a forest fire.\n\nThe DM will secretly roll a proficiency check. A successful\ncheck means the character understood the basic actions of\nthe creature. If the check fails by 4 or less, no information is\ngained. If the check fails by 5 or more, the character misinterprets\nthe actions of the animal.\n\nA character may also imitate the calls and cries of animals\nthat he is reasonably familiar with, based on his background.\n\nThis ability is limited by volume. The roar of a tyrannosaurus\nrex would be beyond the abilities of a normal character. A\nsuccessful proficiency check means that only magical means\ncan distinguish the character's call from that of the true animal.\n\nThe cry is sufficient to fool animals, perhaps frightening\nthem away or luring them closer. A failed check means the\nsound is incorrect in some slight way. A failed call may still\nfool some listeners, but creatures very familiar with the cry\nautomatically detect a false call. All other creatures and characters\nare allowed a Wisdom check to detect the fake.\n\nFinally, animal lore increases the chance of successfully\nsetting snares and traps (for hunting) since the character\nknows the general habits of the creature hunted.
Animal Training: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Wis    Check Mod: 0\nCharacters with this proficiency can train\none type of creature (declared when the proficiency is chosen)\nto obey simple commands and perform tricks. A character\ncan spend additional proficiencies to train other types of\ncreatures or can improve his skill with an already chosen type.\n\nCreatures typically trained are dogs, horses, falcons, pigeons,\nelephants, ferrets, and parrots. A character can choose even\nmore exotic creatures and monsters with animal intelligence\n(although these are difficult to control).\n\nA trainer can work with up to three creatures at one time.\n\nThe trainer may choose to teach general tasks or specific\ntricks. A general task gives the creature the ability to react to a\nnumber of nonspecific commands to do its job. Examples of\ntasks include guard and attack, carry a rider, perform heavy\nlabor, hunt, track, or fight alongside soldiers (such as a war\nhorse or elephant). A specific trick teaches the trained creature\nto do one specific action. A horse may rear on command,\na falcon may pluck a designated object, a dog may attack a\nspecific person, or a rat may run through a particular maze.\n\nWith enough time, a creature can be trained to do both general\ntasks and specific tricks.\n\nTraining for a general task requires three months of uninterrupted\nwork. Training for a specific trick requires 2d6 weeks.\n\nAt the end of the training time, a proficiency check is made. If\nsuccessful, the animal is trained. If the die roll fails, the beast\nis untrainable. An animal can be trained in 2d4 general tasks\nor specific tricks, or any combination of the two.\n\nAn animal trainer can also try to tame wild animals (preparing\nthem for training later on). Wild animals can be tamed\nonly when they are very young. The taming requires one\nmonth of uninterrupted work with the creature. At the end of\nthe month, a proficiency check is made. If successful, the\nbeast is suitable for training. If the check fails, the creature\nretains enough of its wild behavior to make it untrainable. It\ncan be kept, though it must be leashed or caged.
Appraising: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Int    Check Mod: 0\nThis proficiency is highly useful for thieves, as\nit allows characters to estimate the value and authenticity of\nantiques, art objects, jewelry, cut gemstones, or other crafted\nitems they find (although the DM can exclude those items\ntoo exotic or rare to be well known). The character must\nhave the item in hand to examine. A successful proficiency\ncheck (rolled by the DM) enables the character to estimate\nthe value of the item to the nearest 100 or 1,000 gp and to\nidentify fakes. On a failed check, the character cannot estimate\na price at all. On a roll of 20, the character wildly misreads\nthe value of the item, always to the detriment of the\ncharacter.
Armorer: \nSlots: 2    Relevant Ability: Int    Check Mod: -2\nThis character can make all of the types of armor\nlisted in the Player's Handbook, given the proper materials\nand facilities. When making armor, the proficiency check is\nrolled at the end of the normal construction time.\n\nThe time required to make armor is equal to two weeks\nper level of AC below 10. For example, a shield would require\ntwo weeks of work, whereas a suit of full plate armor would\nrequire 18 weeks of work.\n\nIf the proficiency check indicates failure but is within 4 of\nthe amount needed for success, the armorer has created\nusable, but flawed, armor. Such armor functions as 1 AC\nworse than usual, although it looks like the armor it was\nintended to be. Only a character with armorer proficiency can\ndetect the flaws, and this requires careful and detailed\ninspection.\n\nIf the flawed armor is struck in melee combat with a natural\ndie roll of 19 or 20, it breaks. The character's AC immediately\nworsens by 4 additional classes (although never above 10),\nand the broken armor hampers the character's movement.\n\nUntil the character can remove the broken armor (a process\nrequiring 1d4 rounds), the character moves at 1/2 of his normal\nrate and suffers a -4 penalty to all of his attack rolls.\n\nIf an armorer is creating a suit of field plate or full plate\narmor, the character who will use the armor must be present\nat least once a week during the creation of the armor, since\nsuch types of armor require very exact fitting.
Artistic Ability: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Wis    Check Mod: 0\nPlayer characters with artistic ability are\nnaturally accomplished in various forms of the arts. They have\nan inherent understanding of color, form, space, flow, tone,\npitch, and rhythm. Characters with artistic ability must select\none art form (painting, sculpture, composition, etc.) to be\nproficient in. Thereafter they can attempt to create art works\nor musical compositions in their given field. Although it is not\nnecessary to make a proficiency check, one can be made to\ndetermine the quality of the work. If a 1 is rolled on the check,\nthe artist has created a work with some truly lasting value. If\nthe check fails, the artist has created something aesthetically\nunpleasing or just plain bad.\n\nArtistic ability also confers a +1 bonus to all proficiency\nchecks requiring artistic skill--music or dance--and to\nattempts to appraise objects of art.
Astrology: \nSlots: 2    Relevant Ability: Int    Check Mod: 0\nThis proficiency gives the character some\nunderstanding of the supposed influences of the stars.\n\nKnowing the birth date and time of any person, the astrologer\ncan study the stars and celestial events and then prepare\na forecast of the future for that person. The astrologer's\ninsight into the future is limited to the next 30 days, and his\nknowledge is vague at best. If a successful proficiency check\nis made, the astrologer can foresee some general event--a\ngreat battle, a friend lost, a new friendship made, etc. The\n\nDM decides the exact prediction (based on his intentions for\nthe next few gaming sessions). Note that the prediction does\nnot guarantee the result--it only indicates the potential result.\n\nIf the proficiency check is failed, no information is gained\nunless a 20 is rolled, in which case the prediction is wildly\ninaccurate.\n\nClearly this proficiency requires preparation and advance\nknowledge on the part of the DM. Because of this, it is permissible\nfor the DM to avoid the question, although this\nshouldn't be done all the time. Players who want to make\ntheir DM's life easier (always a good idea) should consider\nusing this proficiency at the end of a gaming session, giving\nthe DM until the next session to come up with an answer. The\n\nDM can use this proficiency as a catalyst and guide for his\nadventures--something that will prompt the player characters\nto go to certain places or to try new things.\n\nCharacters with the astrology proficiency gain a +1 bonus\nto all navigation proficiency checks, provided the stars can be\nseen.
Blacksmithing: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Str    Check Mod: 0\nA character with blacksmithing proficiency\nis capable of making tools and implements from iron. Use of\nthe proficiency requires a forge with a coal-fed fire and bellows,\nas well as a hammer and anvil. The character cannot\nmake armor or most weapons, but can craft crowbars, grappling\nhooks, horseshoes, nails, hinges, plows, and most other\niron objects.
Blind-fighting: \nSlots: 2    Relevant Ability: NA    Check Mod: NA\nA character with blind-fighting is skilled at\nfighting in conditions of poor or no light (but this proficiency\ndoes not allow spell use). In total darkness, the character suffers\nonly a -2 penalty to his attack roll (as compared to a -4\npenalty without this proficiency). Under starlight or moonlight,\nthe character incurs only a -1 penalty. The character suffers\nno penalties to his AC because of darkness.\n\nFurthermore, the character retains special abilities that would\nnormally be lost in darkness, although the effectiveness of these\nare reduced by one-half (proficiency checks are made at half\nthe normal score, etc.). This proficiency is effective only against\nopponents or threats within melee distance of the character.\n\nBlind-fighting does not grant any special protection from missile\nfire or anything outside the immediate range of the character's\nmelee weapon. Thus, AC penalties remain for missile fire. (By\nthe time the character hears the whoosh of the arrow, for\nexample, it is too late for him to react.)\n\nWhile moving in darkness, the character suffers only half\nthe normal movement penalty of those without this proficiency.\n\nFurthermore, this skill aids the character when dealing with\ninvisible creatures, reducing the attack penalty to -2. However,\nit does not enable the character to discover invisible\ncreatures; he has only a general idea of their location and\ncannot target them exactly.
Bowyer/Fletcher: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Dex    Check Mod: -1\nThis character can make bows and\narrows of the types given in Table 44.\n\nA weaponsmith is required to fashion arrowheads, but the\nbowyer/fletcher can perform all other necessary functions.\n\nThe construction time for a long or short bow is one week,\nwhile composite bows require two weeks, and 1d6 arrows\ncan be made in one day.\n\nWhen the construction time for the weapon is completed,\nthe player makes a proficiency check. If the check is successful,\nthe weapon is of fine quality and will last for many years\nof normal use without breaking. If the check fails, the weapon\nis still usable, but has a limited life span: An arrow breaks on\nthe first shot; a bow breaks if the character using it rolls an\nunmodified 1 on his 1d20 attack roll.\n\nOption: If a character wishes to create a weapon of truly\nfine quality and the DM allows it, the player can opt to use the\nfollowing alternative procedure for determining the success of\nhis attempt. When the proficiency check is made, any failure\nmeans that the weapon is useless. However, a successful\ncheck means that the weapon enables the character to add\n\nStrength bonuses to attack and damage rolls. Additionally, if\nthe proficiency check is a natural 1, the range of the bow is\nincreased 10 yards for all range classes or is of such fine work\nthat it is suitable for enchantment.
Brewing: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Int    Check Mod: 0\nThe character is trained in the art of brewing\nbeers and other strong drink. The character can prepare brewing\nformulas, select quality ingredients, set up and manage a\nbrewery, control fermentation, and age the finished product.\n\nCarpentry: The carpentry proficiency enables the character\nto do woodworking jobs: building houses, cabinetry, joinery,\netc. Tools and materials must be available. The character\ncan build basic items from experience, without the need for\nplans. Unusual and more complicated items (a catapult, for\nexample) require plans prepared by an engineer. Truly\nunusual or highly complex items (wooden clockwork mechanisms,\nfor example) require a proficiency check.
Charioteering: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Dex    Check Mod: -1\nA character with proficiency in this skill is\nable to safely guide a chariot, over any type of terrain that can\nnormally be negotiated, at a rate one-third faster than the\nnormal movement rate for a chariot driven by a character\nwithout this proficiency. Note that this proficiency does not\nimpart the ability to move a chariot over terrain that it cannot\ntraverse; even the best charioteer in the world cannot take\nsuch a vehicle into the mountains.
Cobbling: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Dex    Check Mod: 0\nThe character can fashion and repair shoes,\nboots, and sandals.
Cooking: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Int    Check Mod: 0\nAlthough all characters have rudimentary cooking\nskills, the character with this proficiency is an accomplished\ncook. A proficiency check is required only when\nattempting to prepare a truly magnificent meal worthy of a\nmaster chef.
Dancing: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Dex    Check Mod: 0\nThe character knows many styles and varieties\nof dance, from folk dances to formal court balls.
Direction Sense: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Wis    Check Mod: +1\nA character with this proficiency has an\ninnate sense of direction. By concentrating for 1d6 rounds,\nthe character can try to determine the direction the party is\nheaded. If the check fails but is less than 20, the character\nerrs by 90 degrees. If a 20 is rolled, the direction chosen is\nexactly opposite the true heading. (The DM rolls the check.)\n\nFurthermore, when traveling in the wilderness, a character\nwith direction sense has the chance of becoming lost reduced\nby 5%.
Disguise: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Cha    Check Mod: -1\nThe character with this skill is trained in the art\nof disguise. He can make himself look like any general type of\nperson of about the same height, age, weight, and race. A\nsuccessful proficiency check indicates that the disguise is successful,\nwhile a failed roll means the attempt was too obvious\nin some way.\n\nThe character can also disguise himself as a member of\nanother race or sex. In this case, a -7 penalty is applied to the\nproficiency check. The character may also attempt to disguise\nhimself as a specific person, with a -10 penalty to the proficiency\ncheck. These modifiers are cumulative, thus, it is\nextremely difficult for a character to disguise himself as a\nspecific person of another race or sex (a -17 penalty to the\ncheck).
Endurance: \nSlots: 2    Relevant Ability: Con    Check Mod: -1\nA character with endurance proficiency is able\nto perform continual strenuous physical activity for twice as\nlong as a normal character before becoming subject to the\neffects of fatigue and exhaustion. In those cases where\nextreme endurance is required, a successful proficiency check\nmust be made. Note that this proficiency does not enable a\ncharacter to extend the length of time that he can remain\nunaffected by a lack of food or water.
Engineering: \nSlots: 2    Relevant Ability: Int    Check Mod: -3\nThe character is trained as a builder of both\ngreat and small things. Engineers can prepare plans for everything\nfrom simple machines (catapults, river locks, grist mills)\nto large buildings (fortresses, dams). A proficiency check is\nrequired only when designing something particularly complicated\nor unusual. An engineer must still find talented workmen\nto carry out his plan, but he is trained to supervise and\nmanage their work.\n\nAn engineer is also familiar with the principles of siegecraft\nand can detect flaws in the defenses of a castle or similar\nconstruction. He knows how to construct and use siege\nweapons and machines, such as catapults, rams, and screws.
Etiquette: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Cha    Check Mod: 0\nThis proficiency gives the character a basic\nunderstanding of the proper forms of behavior and address\nrequired in many different situations, especially those involving\nnobility and persons of rank. Thus, the character will know\nthe correct title to use when addressing a duke, the proper\nsteps of ceremony to greet visiting diplomats, gestures to\navoid in the presence of dwarves, etc. For extremely unusual\noccurrences, a proficiency check must be made for the character\nto know the proper etiquette for the situation (an imperial\nvisit, for example, is a sufficiently rare event).\n\nHowever, having the character know what is correct and\nactually do what is correct are two different matters. The\nencounters must still be role-played by the character. Knowledge\nof etiquette does not give the character protection from\na gaffe or faux pas; many people who know the correct thing\nstill manage to do the exact opposite.
Fire-building: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Wis    Check Mod: -1\nA character with fire-building proficiency\ndoes not normally need a tinderbox to start a fire. Given some\ndry wood and small pieces of tinder, he can start a fire in\n2d20 minutes. Flint and steel are not required. Wet wood,\nhigh winds, or other adverse conditions increase the time to\n3d20, and a successful proficiency check must be rolled to\nstart a fire.
Fishing: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Wis    Check Mod: -1\nThe character is skilled in the art of fishing, be it\nwith hook and line, net, or spear. Each hour the character\nspends fishing, roll a proficiency check. If the roll is failed, no\nfish are caught that hour. Otherwise, a hook and line or a\nspear will land fish equal to the difference between the die\nroll and the character's Wisdom score. A net will catch three\ntimes this amount.\n\nOf course, no fish can be caught where no fish are found.\n\nOn the other hand, some areas teem with fish, such as a river\nor pool during spawning season. The DM may modify the\nresults according to the situation.
Forgery: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Dex    Check Mod: -1\nThis proficiency enables the character to create\nduplicates of documents and handwriting and to detect such\nforgeries created by others. To forge a document (military\norders, local decrees, etc.) where the handwriting is not specific\nto a person, the character needs only to have seen a\nsimilar document before. To forge a name, an autograph of\nthat person is needed, and a proficiency check with a -2\npenalty must be successfully rolled. To forge a longer document\nwritten in the hand of some particular person, a large\nsample of his handwriting is needed, with a -3 penalty to the\ncheck.\n\nIt is important to note that the forger always thinks he has\nbeen successful; the DM rolls the character's proficiency\ncheck in secret and the forger does not learn of a failure until\nit is too late.\n\nIf the check succeeds, the work will pass examination by\nall except those intimately familiar with that handwriting or by\nthose with the forgery proficiency who examine the document\ncarefully. If the check is failed, the forgery is detectable\nto anyone familiar with the type of document or handwriting--\nif he examines the document closely. If the die roll is a\n20, the forgery is immediately detectable to anyone who\nnormally handles such documents without close examination.\n\nThe forger will not realize this until too late.\n\nFurthermore, those with forgery proficiency may examine\na document to learn if it is a forgery. On a successful proficiency\nroll, the authenticity of any document can be ascertained.\n\nIf the die roll is failed but a 20 is not rolled, the\nanswer is unknown. If a 20 is rolled, the character reaches\nthe incorrect conclusion.
Gaming: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Cha    Check Mod: 0\nThe character knows most common games of\nchance and skill, including cards, dice, bones, draughts, and\nchess. When playing a game, the character may either play\nout the actual game (which may take too much time for\nsome) or make a proficiency check, with success indicating\nvictory. If two proficient characters play each other, the one\nwith the highest successful die roll wins. A character with\ngaming proficiency can also attempt to cheat, thus gaining a\n+1 bonus to his ability score. If the proficiency check for the\ngame is 17 to 20, however, the character has been caught\ncheating (even if he won the game).
Gem Cutting: \nSlots: 2    Relevant Ability: Dex    Check Mod: -2\nA character with this proficiency can finish\nthe rough gems that are discovered through mining at a rate\nof 1d10 stones per day. A gem cutter derives no benefit from\nthe assistance of nonproficient characters. A gem cutter must\nwork with a good light source and must have an assortment\nof chisels, small hammers, and specially hardened blades.\n\nUncut gems, while still of value, are not nearly as valuable\nas the finished product. If the cutting is successful (as determined\nby a proficiency check), the gem cutter increases the\nvalue of a given stone to the range appropriate for its type. If\na 1 is rolled, the work is exceptionally brilliant and the value\nof the gem falls into the range for the next most valuable gem\n(the DM has the relevant tables).
Healing: \nSlots: 2    Relevant Ability: Wis    Check Mod: -2\nA character proficient in healing knows how to\nuse natural medicines and basic principles of first aid and\ndoctoring. If the character tends another within one round of\nwounding (and makes a successful proficiency check), his\nministrations restore 1d3 hit points (but no more hit points\ncan be restored than were lost in the previous round). Only\none healing attempt can be made on a character per day.\n\nIf a wounded character remains under the care of someone\nwith healing proficiency, that character can recover lost\nhit points at the rate of 1 per day even when traveling or\nengaging in nonstrenuous activity. If the wounded character\ngets complete rest, he can recover 2 hit points per day while\nunder such care. Only characters with both healing and herbalism\nproficiencies can help others recover at the rate of 3 hit\npoints per day of rest. This care does not require a proficiency\ncheck, only the regular attention of the proficient character.\n\nUp to six patients can be cared for at any time.\n\nA character with healing proficiency can also attempt to\naid a poisoned individual, provided the poison entered\nthrough a wound. If the poisoned character can be tended to\nimmediately (the round after the character is poisoned) and\nthe care continues for the next five rounds, the victim gains a\n+2 bonus to his saving throw (delay his saving throw until\nthe last round of tending). No proficiency check is required,\nbut the poisoned character must be tended to immediately\n(normally by sacrificing any other action by the proficient\ncharacter) and cannot do anything himself. If the care and\nrest are interrupted, the poisoned character must immediately\nroll a normal saving throw for the poison. This result is\nunalterable by normal means (i.e., more healing doesn't\nhelp). Only characters with both healing and herbalism proficiencies\ncan attempt the same treatment for poisons the\nvictim has swallowed or touched (the character uses his\nhealing to diagnose the poison and his herbalist knowledge\nto prepare a purgative).\n\nA character with healing proficiency can also attempt to\ndiagnose and treat diseases. When dealing with normal diseases,\na successful proficiency check automatically reduces\nthe disease to its mildest form and shortest duration. Those\nwho also have herbalism knowledge gain an additional +2\nbonus to this check. A proficient character can also attempt\nto deal with magical diseases, whether caused by spells or\ncreatures. In this case, a successful proficiency check diagnoses\nthe cause of the disease. However, since the disease is\nmagical in nature, it can be treated only by magical means.
Heraldry: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Int    Check Mod: 0\nThe knowledge of heraldry enables the character\nto identify the different crests and symbols that denote\ndifferent persons and groups. Heraldry comes in many forms\nand is used for many different purposes. It can be used to\nidentify noblemen, families, guilds, sects, legions, political\nfactions, and castes. The symbols may appear on flags,\nshields, helmets, badges, embroidery, standards, clothing,\ncoins, and more. The symbols used may include geometric\npatterns, calligraphed lines of script, fantastic beasts, religious\nsymbols, and magical seals (made for the express purpose\nof identification). Heraldry can vary from the highly formalized\nrules and regulations of late medieval Europe to the\nknowledge of different shield patterns and shapes used by\n\nAfrican tribesmen.\n\nThe character automatically knows the different heraldic\nsymbols of his homeland and whom they are associated with.\n\nIn addition, if the character makes a successful proficiency\ncheck, he can correctly identify the signs and symbols of other\nlands, provided he has at least a passing knowledge of the\ninhabitants of that land. His heraldry skill is of little use upon\nfirst entering a foreign land.
Herbalism: \nSlots: 2    Relevant Ability: Int    Check Mod: -2\nThose with herbalist knowledge can identify\nplants and fungus and prepare nonmagical potions, poultices,\npowders, balms, salves, ointments, infusions, and plasters for\nmedical and pseudo-medical purposes. They can also prepare\nnatural plant poisons and purgatives. The DM must\ndecide the exact strength of such poisons based on the poison\nrules in the DMG. A character with both herbalism and\nhealing proficiencies gains bonuses when using his healing\ntalent (see the Healing proficiency).
Hunting: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Wis    Check Mod: -1\nWhen in wilderness settings, the character can\nattempt to stalk and bring down game. A proficiency check\nmust be made with a -1 penalty to the ability score for every\nnonproficient hunter in the party. If the die roll is successful,\nthe hunter (and those with him) have come within 101 to\n200 yards (100+1d100) of an animal. The group can\nattempt to close the range, but a proficiency check must be\nmade for each 20 yards closed. If the stalking is successful,\nthe hunter automatically surprises the game. The type of animal\nstalked depends on the nature of the terrain and the\nwhim of the DM.
Juggling: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Dex    Check Mod: -1\nThe character can juggle, a talent useful for\nentertainments, diversions, and certain rare emergencies.\n\nWhen juggling normally (to entertain or distract), no proficiency\ncheck is required. A check is made when trying spectacular\ntricks ("Watch me eat this apple in mid-air!").\n\nHowever, juggling also enables the character to attempt\ndesperate moves. On a successful attack roll vs. AC 0 (not a\nproficiency check), the character can catch small items\nthrown to harm him (as opposed to items thrown for him to\ncatch). Thus, the character could catch a dagger or a dart\nbefore it hits. If this attack roll fails, however, the character\nautomatically suffers damage (sticking your hand in the path\nof a dagger is likely to hurt)
Jumping: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Str    Check Mod: 0\nThe character can attempt exceptional leaps\nboth vertically and horizontally. If the character has at least a\n20-foot running start, he can leap (broad jump) 2d6+his\nlevel in feet. No character can broad jump more than six\ntimes his height, however. With the same start, he can leap\nvertically (high jump) 1d3 plus half his level in feet. No character\ncan high jump more than 11/2 times his own height.\n\nFrom a standing start, a character with this proficiency can\nbroad jump 1d6 plus half his level in feet and high jump only\n3 feet.\n\nThe character can also attempt vaults using a pole. A vault\nrequires at least a 30-foot running start. If a pole is used, it\nmust be 4 to 10 feet longer than the character's height. The\nvault spans a distance equal to 11/2 times the length of the\npole. The character can clear heights equal to the height of\nthe pole. He can also choose to land on his feet if the vault\ncarries him over an obstacle no higher than 1/2 the height of his\npole. Thus, using a 12-foot pole, the character could either\nvault through a window 12 feet off the ground (tumbling into\nthe room beyond), land on his feet in an opening 6 feet off\nthe ground, or vault across a moat 18 feet wide. In all cases,\nthe pole is dropped at the end of the vault.
Languages, Ancient: \nSlots:  1   Relevant Ability: Int    Check Mod: 0\nThe character has mastered a difficult\nand obscure tongue, now primarily found in the writings\nof pedantic sages and sorcerers. The main use of the language\nis to read tomes of ancient secrets written by longdead\nmystics. This proficiency enables the character to either\nread and write or speak the language (his choice).
Languages, Modern: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Int    Check Mod: 0\nThe character has learned to speak\na language of the known world. To do so, there must be a\nteacher available. This could be another player character, an\n\nNPC hireling, or simply a local townsman.\n\nLeatherworking: This proficiency enables a character to\ntan and treat leather and to make clothing and other leather\nobjects. The character can make leather armor, as well as\nbackpacks, saddlebags, saddles, and all sorts of harnesses.
Local History: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Cha    Check Mod: 0\nThe character is a storehouse of facts about\nthe history of a region the size of a large county or a small\nprovince. The character knows when the ruined tower on the\nhill was built and who built it (and what happened to him),\nwhat great heroes and villains fought and fell at the old battlefield,\nwhat great treasure is supposed to be kept in a local\ntemple, how the mayor of the next town miraculously grew\nhair on his balding pate, and more.\n\nThe DM will provide information about local sites and\nevents as the character needs to know them. Furthermore,\nthe character can try to retell these events as entertaining\nstories. Once the subject is chosen, he can either make a\nproficiency check and, if successful, add that tale to his repertoire,\nor actually tell the story to other characters. If the character\nsucceeds in entertaining them, the player need not\nmake a proficiency roll for the character, since he has succeeded.\n\nThe character can tell these stories to entertain others,\ngranting him a +2 bonus to his Charisma for the\nencounter. But telling stories to hostile beings is probably not\ngoing to do any good.
Mining: \nSlots: 2    Relevant Ability: Wis    Check Mod: -3\nA character with mining proficiency is needed to\nsite and supervise the operations of any mine. First, the character\ncan attempt to determine what types of ores or gems\ncan be found in a given area. To do this, he must spend at\nleast a week searching a four-square-mile area. The DM may\nrule that more area must be searched to find anything of\nvalue and may thus increase the amount of time required. At\nthe end of the search, the character can say what is likely to\nbe found in this area. After this, the character can site the\nmine. On a successful proficiency check (made secretly by\nthe DM), the character has found a good site to begin mining\nfor any minerals that may be in the area. The check does not\nguarantee a successful mine, only that a particular site is the\nbest choice in a given area. The DM must determine what\nminerals, if any, are to be found in the region of the mine. On\na failed check, the character only thinks he has found a good\nsite. Much effort is spent before the character is proved\nwrong, of course.\n\nOnce the mine is in operation, a character with mining\nproficiency must remain on site to supervise all work. Although\nthis is a steady job, most player characters will find it better to\nhire an NPC for this purpose.
Mountaineering: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: NA    Check Mod: NA\nA character with this proficiency can\nmake difficult and dangerous climbs up steep slopes and\ncliffs with the aid of spikes, ropes, etc. If a character with\nmountaineering proficiency leads a party, placing the pitons\n(spikes) and guiding the others, all in the party can gain the\nbenefit of his knowledge. A mountaineer can guide a party up\na cliff face it could not otherwise climb. A character with this\nproficiency gains a 10% bonus per proficiency slot spent to\nhis chance to climb any surface. Note that mountaineering is\nnot the same as the thief's climbing ability, since the latter\ndoes not require aids of any sort.
Musical Instrument: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Dex    Check Mod: -1\nThe character can play a specific\nmusical instrument. An additional instrument can be added\nfor every extra slot devoted to this proficiency. The character\nplays quite well, and no proficiency check is normally\nrequired. The DM may direct the character to make a proficiency\ncheck in what he feels are extraordinary circumstances.
Navigation: \nSlots:     Relevant Ability:     Check Mod: \nThe character has learned the arts of navigating\nby the stars, studying currents, and watching for telltale\nsigns of land, reefs, and hidden danger. This is not particularly\nuseful on land. At sea, a successful proficiency check by the\nnavigator reduces the chance of getting lost by 20 percent.
Pottery: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Dex    Check Mod: -2\nA character with this proficiency can create any\ntype of clay vessel or container commonly used in the campaign\nworld. The character requires a wheel and a kiln, as well\nas a supply of clay and glaze. The character can generally\ncreate two small- or medium-sized items or one large-sized\nitem per day. The pieces of pottery must then be fired in the\nkiln for an additional day.\n\nThe raw materials involved cost 3 cp to make a small\nitem, 5 cp to make a medium-sized item, and 1 sp to make\na large item.
Reading Lips: \nSlots: 2    Relevant Ability: Int    Check Mod: -2\nThe character can understand the speech of\nthose he can see but not hear. When this proficiency is chosen,\nthe player must specify what language the character can lip\nread (it must be a language the character can already speak).\n\nTo use the proficiency, the character must be within 30 feet of\nthe speaker and be able to see him speak. A proficiency check\nis made. If the check fails, nothing is learned. If the check is\nsuccessful, 70% of the conversation is understood. Since certain\nsounds are impossible to differentiate, the understanding\nof a lip-read conversation is never better than this.
Reading/Writing: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Int    Check Mod: +1\nThe character can read and write a\nmodern language he can speak, provided there is someone\navailable to teach the character (another PC, a hireling, or an\n\nNPC). This proficiency does not enable the character to read\nancient languages (see Languages, Ancient).
Religion: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Wis    Check Mod: 0\nCharacters with religion proficiency know the\ncommon beliefs and cults of their homeland and the major\nfaiths of neighboring regions. Ordinary information (type of\nreligious symbol used, basic attitude of the faith, etc.) of any\nreligion is automatically known by the character. Special information,\nsuch as how the clergy is organized or the significance\nof particular holy days, requires a proficiency check.\n\nAdditional proficiencies spent on religion enable the character\neither to expand his general knowledge into more distant\nregions (using the guidelines above) or to gain precise\ninformation about a single faith. If the latter is chosen, the\ncharacter is no longer required to make a proficiency check\nwhen answering questions about that religion. Such expert\nknowledge is highly useful to priest characters when dealing\nwith their own and rival faiths.
Riding, Airborne: \nSlots: 2    Relevant Ability: Wis    Check Mod: -2\nThe character is trained in handling a\nflying mount. The particular creature must be chosen when\nthe proficiency is chosen. Additional proficiency slots can be\nused to learn how to handle other types of mounts. Unlike\nland-based riding, a character must have this proficiency (or\nride with someone who does) to handle a flying mount. In\naddition, a proficient character can do the following:\n- Leap onto the saddle of the creature (when it is standing on\nthe ground) and spur it airborne as a single action. This\nrequires no proficiency check.\n- Leap from the back of the mount and drop 10 feet to the\nground or onto the back of another mount (land-based or\nflying). Those with only light encumbrance can drop to the\nground without a proficiency check. In all other situations, a\nproficiency check is required. A failed roll means the character\ntakes normal falling damage (for falling flat on his face)\nor misses his target (perhaps taking large amounts of damage\nas a result). A character who is dropping to the ground\ncan attempt an immediate melee attack, if his proficiency\ncheck is made with a -4 penalty to the ability roll. Failure\nhas the consequences given above.\n- Spur his mount to greater speeds on a successful check,\nadding 1d4 to the movement rate of the mount. This speed\ncan be maintained for four consecutive rounds. If the check\nfails, an attempt can be made again the next round. If two\nchecks fail, no attempt can be made for a full turn. After the\nrounds of increased speed, its movement drops to 2/3 its\nnormal rate and its Maneuverability Class (see Glossary)\nbecomes one class worse. These conditions last until the\nmount lands and is allowed to rest for at least one hour.\n- The rider can guide the mount with his knees and feet,\nkeeping his hands free. A proficiency check is made only\nafter the character suffers damage. If the check is failed, the\ncharacter is knocked from the saddle. A second check is\nallowed to see if the character manages to catch himself\n(thus hanging from the side by one hand or in some equally\nperilous position). If this fails, the rider falls. Of course a\nrider can strap himself into the saddle, although this could\nbe a disadvantage if his mount is slain and plummets\ntoward the ground.
Riding, Land-Based: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Wis    Check Mod: +3\nThose skilled in land riding are\nproficient in the art of riding and handling horses or other\ntypes of ground mounts. When the proficiency slot is filled,\nthe character must declare which type of mount he is proficient\nin. Possibilities include unicorns, dire wolves, and\nvirtually any creatures used as mounts by humans, demihumans,\nor humanoids.\n\nA character with riding proficiency can perform all of the\nfollowing feats. Some of them are automatic, while others\nrequire a proficiency check for success.\n- The character with riding proficiency can perform all of the\nor other mount is standing still, even when the character is\nwearing armor. This does not require a proficiency check.\n\nThe character must make a check, however, if he wishes to\nget the mount moving during the same round in which he\nlands in its saddle. He must also make a proficiency check\nif he attempts to vault onto the saddle of a moving mount.\n\nFailure indicates that the character falls to the ground--presumably\nquite embarrassed.\n- The character can urge the mount to jump tall obstacles or\nleap across gaps. No check is required if the obstacle is less\nthan 3 feet tall or the gap is less than 12 feet wide. If the\ncharacter wants to roll a proficiency check, the mount can be\nurged to leap obstacles up to 7 feet high, or jump across\ngaps up to 30 feet wide. Success means that the mount has\nmade the jump. Failure indicates that it balks, and the character\nmust make another proficiency check to see whether he\nretains his seat or falls to the ground.\n- The character can spur his steed on to great speeds, adding\n6 feet per round to the animal's movement rate for up to\nfour turns. This requires a proficiency check each turn to see\nif the mount can be pushed this hard. If the initial check\nfails, no further attempts may be made, but the mount can\nmove normally. If the second or subsequent check fails, the\nmount immediately slows to a walk, and the character must\ndismount and lead the animal for a turn. In any event, after\nfour turns of racing, the steed must be walked by its dismounted\nrider for one turn.\n- The character can guide his mount with his knees,\nenabling him to use weapons that require two hands\n(such as bows and two-handed swords) while mounted.\n\nThis feat does not require a proficiency check unless the\ncharacter takes damage while so riding. In this case, a\ncheck is required and failure means that the character\nfalls to the ground and sustains an additional 1d6 points\nof damage.\n- The character can drop down and hand alongside the\nsteed, using it as a shield against attack. The character cannot\nmake an attack or wear armor while performing this\nfeat. The character's Armor Class is lowered by 6 while this\nmaneuver is performed. Any attacks that would have\nstruck the character's normal Armor Class are considered\nto have struck the mount instead. No proficiency check is\nrequired.\n\nThe character can leap from the back of his steed to the\nground and make a melee attack against any character or\ncreature within 10 feet. The player must roll a successful\nproficiency check with a -4 penalty to succeed. On a failed\nroll, the character fails to land on his feet, falls clumsily to\nthe ground, and suffers 1d3 points of damage.
Rope Use: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Dex    Check Mod: 0\nThis proficiency enables a character to accomplish\namazing feats with rope. A character with rope use\nproficiency is familiar with all sorts of knots and can tie knots\nthat slip, hold tightly, slide slowly, or loosen with a quick tug.\n\nIf the character's hands are bound and held with a knot, he\ncan roll a proficiency check (with a -6 penalty) to escape the\nbonds.\n\nThis character gains a +2 bonus to all attacks made with a\nlasso. The character also receives a +10% bonus to all climbing\nchecks made while he is using a rope, including attempts\nto belay (secure the end of a climbing rope to) companions.
Running: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Con    Check Mod: -6\nThe character can move at twice his normal\nmovement rate for a day. At the end of the day he must sleep\nfor eight hours. After the first day's movement, the character\nmust roll a proficiency check for success. If the die roll succeeds,\nthe character can continue his running movement the\nnext day. If the die roll fails, the character cannot use his running\nability the next day. If involved in a battle during a day he\nspent running, he suffers a -1 penalty to his attack rolls.
Seamanship: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Dex    Check Mod: +1\nThe character is familiar with boats and\nships. He is qualified to work as a crewman, although he cannot\nactually navigate. Crews of trained seamen are necessary\nto manage any ship, and they improve the movement rates\nof inland boats by 50 percent.
Seamstress/Tailor: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Dex    Check Mod: -1\nThe character can sew and design\nclothing. He can also do all kinds of embroidery and ornamental\nwork. Although no proficiency check is required, the\ncharacter must have at least needle and thread to work.
Set Snares: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Dex    Check Mod: -1\nThe character can make simple snares and\ntraps, primarily to catch small game. These can include rope\nsnares and spring traps. A proficiency check must be rolled\nwhen the snare is first constructed and every time the snare\nis set. A failed proficiency check means the trap does not\nwork for some reason. It may be that the workmanship was\nbad, the character left too much scent in the area, or he\npoorly concealed the finished work. The exact nature of the\nproblem does not need to be known. The character can also\nattempt to set traps and snares for larger creatures: tiger pits\nand net snares, for example. A proficiency check must be\nrolled, this time with a -4 penalty to the ability score. In both\ncases, setting a successful snare does not ensure that it\ncatches anything, only that the snare works if triggered. The\n\nDM must decide if the trap is triggered.\n\nThief characters (and only thieves) with this proficiency\ncan also attempt to rig man-traps. These can involve such\nthings as crossbows, deadfalls, spiked springboards, etc. The\nprocedure is the same as that for setting a large snare. The\n\nDM must determine the amount of damage caused by a\nman-trap.\n\nSetting a small snare or trap takes one hour of work. Setting\na larger trap requires two to three people (only one need\nhave the proficiency) and 2d4 hours of work. Setting a mantrap\nrequires one or more people (depending on its nature)\nand 1d8 hours of work. To prepare any trap, the character\nmust have appropriate materials on hand.\n\nCharacters with animal lore proficiency gain a +2 bonus to\ntheir ability score when attempting to set a snare for the purposes\nof catching game. Their knowledge of animals and the\nwoods serves them well for this purpose. They gain no benefit\nwhen attempting to trap monsters or intelligent beings.
Singing: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Cha    Check Mod: 0\nThe character is an accomplished singer and can\nuse this ability to entertain others and perhaps earn a small\nliving (note that bards can do this automatically). No proficiency\ncheck is required to sing. The character can also create\nchoral works on a successful proficiency check.
Spellcraft: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Wis    Check Mod: 0\nAlthough this proficiency does not grant the\ncharacter any spellcasting powers, it does give him familiarity\nwith the different forms and rites of spellcasting. If he observes\nand overhears someone who is casting a spell, or if he examines\nthe material components used, he can attempt to identify\nthe spell being cast. A proficiency check must be rolled to\nmake a correct identification. Wizard specialists gain a +3\nbonus to the check when attempting to identify magic of their\nown school. Note that since the spellcaster must be observed\nuntil the very instant of casting, the spellcraft proficiency does\nnot grant an advantage against combat spells. The proficiency\nis quite useful, however, for identifying spells that would otherwise\nhave no visible effect.\n\nThose talented in this proficiency also have a chance (equal\nto half of their normal proficiency check) of recognizing magical\nor magically endowed constructs for what they are.
Stonemasonry: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Str    Check Mod: -2\nA stonemason is able to build structures\nfrom stone so that they last many years. He can do simple\nstone carvings, such as lettering, columns, and flourishes. The\nstone can be mortared, carefully fitted without mortar, or\nloosely fitted and chinked with rocks and earth. A stonemason\nequipped with his tools (hammers, chisels, wedges,\nblock and tackle) can build a plain section of wall 1 foot thick,\n10 feet long, and 5 feet high in one day, provided the stone\nhas already been cut. A stonemason can also supervise the\nwork of unskilled laborers to quarry stone; one stonemason is\nneeded for every five laborers. Dwarves are among the most\naccomplished stonemasons in the world; they receive a +2\nbonus when using this skill.
Survival: \nSlots: 2    Relevant Ability: Int    Check Mod: 0\nThis proficiency must be applied to a specific\nenvironment--i.e., a specific type of terrain and weather factors.\n\nTypical environments include arctic, woodland, desert,\nsteppe, mountain, or tropical. The character has basic survival\nknowledge for that terrain type. Additional proficiency slots\ncan be used to add more types of terrain.\n\nA character skilled in survival has a basic knowledge of the\nhazards he might face in that land. He understands the\neffects of the weather and knows the proper steps to lessen\nthe risk of exposure. He knows the methods to locate or\ngather drinkable water. He knows how to find basic, not necessarily\nappetizing, food where none is apparent, thus staving\noff starvation. Furthermore, a character with the survival\nskill can instruct and aid others in the same situation. When\nusing the proficiency to find food or water, the character\nmust roll a proficiency check. If the check is failed, no more\nattempts can be made that day.\n\nThe survival skill in no way releases the player characters\nfrom the hardships and horrors of being lost in the wilderness.\n\nAt best it alleviates a small portion of the suffering. The\nfood found is barely adequate, and water is discovered in\nminuscule amounts. It is still quite possible for a character\nwith survival knowledge to die in the wilderness. Indeed, the\nlittle knowledge the character has may lead to overconfidence\nand doom!
Swimming: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Str    Check Mod: 0\nA character with swimming proficiency knows\nhow to swim and can move according to the rules given in\nthe Swimming section (Chapter 14: Time and Movement).\n\nThose without this proficiency cannot swim. They can hold\ntheir breath and float, but they cannot move themselves\nabout in the water
Tightrope Walking: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Dex    Check Mod: 0\nThe character can attempt to walk narrow\nropes or beams with greater than normal chances of\nsuccess. He can negotiate any narrow surface not angled up\nor down greater than 45 degrees. Each round the character\ncan walk 60 feet. One proficiency check is made every 60\nfeet (or part thereof), with failure indicating a fall. The check\nis made with a -10 penalty to the ability score if the surface\nis 1 inch or less in width (a rope), a -5 penalty if 2 inches to\n6 inches wide, and unmodified if 7 inches to 12 inches wide.\n\nWider than 1 foot requires no check for proficient characters\nunder normal circumstances. Every additional proficiency\nspent on tightrope walking reduces these penalties by 1. Use\nof a balancing rod reduces the penalties by 2. Winds or vibrations\nin the line increases the penalties by 2 to 6.\n\nThe character can attempt to fight while on a tightrope, but\nhe suffers a -5 penalty to his attack roll and must roll a successful\nproficiency check at the beginning of each round to\navoid falling off. Since the character cannot maneuver, he\ngains no adjustments to his Armor Class for Dexterity. If he is\nstruck while on the rope, he must roll an immediate proficiency\ncheck to retain his balance.
Tracking: \nSlots: 2    Relevant Ability: Wis    Check Mod: 0\nCharacters with tracking proficiency are able to\nfollow the trail of creatures and characters across most types\nof terrain. Characters who are not rangers roll a proficiency\ncheck with a -6 penalty to their ability scores; rangers have\nno penalty to their ability scores. In addition, other modifiers\nare also applied to the attempt, according to Table 39.\n\nThe modifiers in Table 39 are cumulative--total the modifiers\nfor all conditions that apply and combine that with the\ntracker's Wisdom score to get the modified chance to track.\n\nFor example, if Thule's Wisdom score is 16 and he is trying\nto track through mud (+4), at night (-6), during a sleet\nstorm (-5), his chance to track is 9 (16+4-6-5). (Thule is\na ranger so he does not suffer the -6 penalty for non-rangers\ntracking.)\n\nFor tracking to succeed, the creature tracked must leave\nsome type of trail. Thus, it is virtually impossible to track flying\nor noncorporeal creatures. The DM may allow this in rare\ninstances, but he should also assign substantial penalties to\nthe attempt.\n\nTo track a creature, the character must first find the trail.\n\nIndoors, the tracker must have seen the creature in the last\n30 minutes and must begin tracking from the place last seen.\n\nOutdoors, the tracker must either have seen the creature,\nhave eyewitness reports of its recent movement ("Yup, we\nsaw them orcs just high-tail it up that trail there not but yesterday."),\nor must have obvious evidence that the creature is\nin the area (such as a well-used game trail). If these conditions\nare met, a proficiency check is rolled. Success means a\ntrail has been found. Failure means no trail has been found.\n\nAnother attempt cannot be made until the above conditions\nare met again under different circumstances.\n\nOnce the trail is found, additional proficiency checks are\nrolled for the following situations:\n- The chance to track decreases (terrain, rain, creatures leaving\nthe group, darkness, etc)\n- A second track crosses the first\n- The party resumes tracking after a halt (to rest, eat, fight, \netc.)\n\nOnce the tracker fails a proficiency check, another check\ncan be rolled after spending at least one hour searching the\narea for new signs. If this check is failed, no further attempts\ncan be made. If several trackers are following a trail, a +1\nbonus is added to the ability score of the most adept tracker.\n\nOnce he loses the trail, it is lost to all.\n\nIf the modifiers lower the chance to track below 0 (for\nexample, the modifiers are -11 and the character's Wisdom\nis 10), the trail is totally lost to that character and further\ntracking is impossible (even if the chance later improves).\n\nOther characters may be able to continue tracking, but that\ncharacter cannot.\n\nA tracking character can also attempt to identify the type of\ncreatures being followed and the approximate number by rolling\na proficiency check. All the normal tracking modifiers apply.\n\nOne identifying check can be rolled each time a check is rolled\nto follow the trail. A successful check identifies the creatures\n(provided the character has some knowledge of that type of\ncreature) and gives a rough estimate of their numbers. Just how\naccurate this estimate is depends on the DM.\n\nWhen following a trail, the character (and those with him)\nmust slow down, the speed depending on the character's\nmodified chance to track as found from Table 39.\n\nIn the earlier example, Thule has a modified tracking\nchance of 9, so he moves at 1/2 his normal movement rate.\n\nMovement While Tracking:\n\nChance to track            Movement Rate\n 1 - 6                             1/4 normal\n 7 - 14                            1/2 normal\n14 +                                 3/4\n\nTracking Modifiers\n\nTerrain                                                                     Modifier\nsoft or muddy ground                                            +4\nthick brush, vines, or reeds                            +3\noccasional signs of passage, dust                 +2\nnormal ground, wood floor                                    0\nrocky ground or shallow water                         -10\nevery two greatures in the group                    +1\nevery 12 hours since the trail was made     -1\nevery hour of rain, snow, or sleet                -5\npoor lighting (moon or starlight)                 -6\ntracked party attempts to hide trail            -5
Tumbling: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Dex    Check Mod: 0\nThe character is practiced in all manner of acrobatics--\ndives, rolls, somersaults, handstands, flips, etc. Tumbling\ncan only be performed while burdened with light\nencumbrance or less. Aside from entertaining, the character\nwith tumbling proficiency can improve his Armor Class by 4\nagainst attacks directed solely at him in any round of combat,\nprovided he has the initiative and foregoes all attacks that\nround. When in unarmed combat he can improve his attack\nroll by 2.\n\nOn a successful proficiency check, he suffers only one-half\nthe normal damage from falls of 60 feet or less and none\nfrom falls of 10 feet or less. Falls from greater heights result in\nnormal damage.
Ventriloquism: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Int    Check Mod: -2\nThe character has learned the secrets of\n"throwing his voice." Although not actually making sound come\nfrom somewhere else (like the spell), the character can deceive\nothers into believing this to be so. When using ventriloquism,\nthe supposed source of the sound must be relatively close to\nthe character. The nature of the speaking object and the intelligence\nof those watching can modify the character's chance of\nsuccess. If the character makes an obviously inanimate object\ntalk (a book, mug, etc.), a -5 penalty is applied to his ability\nscore. If a believable source (a PC or NPC) is made to appear to\nspeak, a +2 bonus is added to his ability score. The observer's\nintelligence modifies this as follows:\n\nIntelligence     Modifier\n<3                         +6\n 3 - 5                 +4\n 6 - 8                 +2\n 9 - 14                0\n15 - 16                -1\n17 - 18                -2\n19 +                     -4\n\nA successful proficiency check means the character has\nsuccessfully deceived his audience. One check must be\nmade for every sentence or response. The character is limited\nto sounds he could normally make (thus, the roar of a lion is\nsomewhat beyond him).\n\nSince ventriloquism relies on deception, people's knowledge\nof speech, and assumptions about what should and\nshouldn't talk, it is effective only on intelligent creatures.\n\nThus, it has no effect on animals and the like. Furthermore,\nthe audience must be watching the character since part of\nthe deception is visual ("Hey, his lips don't move!"). Using\nventriloquism to get someone to look behind him does not\nwork, since the voice is not actually behind him (this requires\nthe ventriloquism spell). All but those with the gullibility of\nchildren realize what is truly happening. They may be\namused--or they may not be.
Weaponsmithing: \nSlots: 3    Relevant Ability: Int    Check Mod: -3\nThis highly specialized proficiency\nenables a character to perform the difficult and highly exacting\nwork involved in making metal weapons, particularly\nthose with blades. The character blends some of the skill of\nthe blacksmith with an ability to create blades of strength and\nsharpness. A fully equipped smithy is necessary to use this\nproficiency.\n\nThe time and cost to make various types of weapons are\nlisted on Table 41.\n\nWeapon Construction\n\nWeapon                     Time         Material Cost\narrowhead                10/day        1 cp\nbattle axe             10 days    10 sp\nhand axe                    5 days     5 sp\ndagger                        5 days     2 sp\nheavy crossbow     20 days    10 sp\nlight crossboy     15 days     5 sp\nfork, trident        20 days    10 sp\nspear, land             4 days     4 sp\nshort sword            20 days     5 sp\nlong sword             30 days    10 sp\n2-hand sword         45 days     2 gp
Weather Sense: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Wis    Check Mod: -1\nThis proficiency enables the character to\nmake intelligent guesses about upcoming weather conditions.\n\nA successful proficiency check means the character has correctly\nguessed the general weather conditions in the next six\nhours. A failed check means the character read the signs wrong\nand forecast the weather incorrectly. The DM should roll the\ncheck secretly. A proficiency check can be made once every six\nhours. However, for every six hours of observation, the character\ngains a +1 bonus to his ability score (as he watches the\nweather change, the character gets a better sense of what is\ncoming). This modifier is cumulative, although sleep or other\nactivity that occupies the attention of the character for a long\nperiod negates any accumulated bonus.\n\nSometimes impending weather conditions are so obvious\nthat no proficiency check is required. It is difficult not to notice\nthe tornado funnel tearing across the plain or the mass of\ndark clouds on the horizon obviously headed the character's\nway. In these cases, the player should be able to deduce what\nis about to happen to his character anyway
Weaving: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Int    Check Mod: -1\nA character with weaving proficiency is able to\ncreate garments, tapestries, and draperies from wool or cotton.\n\nThe character requires a spinning apparatus and a loom.\n\nA weaver can create two square yards of material per day.
Alertness: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Wis    Check Mod: +1\nA character with this proficiency is\nable to instinctively notice and recognize\nsigns of a disturbance in the imme\ndiate vicinity, reducing by 1 in 10 the\ncharacter's chance of being surprised\nwhenever he makes a successful proficiency\ncheck.
Animal Noise: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Wis    Check Mod: -1\nA character with this proficiency is\ncapable of imitating noises made by\nvarious animals. A successful proficiency\ncheck means that only magic\ncan distinguish the noise from that of\nthe actual animal being imitated. A\nfailed die roll means that the sound varies\nfrom the correct noise in some slight\nway.\n\nIf the die roll fails, this does not mean\nthat all creatures hearing the noise\nknow that the sound is fake. While\ncreatures and humanoids that are very\nfamiliar with the noise know this auto-\nmatically, other creatures or characters\nin earshot may require Wisdom checks\nto determine if they detect the fake.\n\nBandits and Smugglers often use this\nability for communication on the job,\nalmost as a variant dialect of thieves\ncant.
Begging: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Cha    Check Mod: NA\nThis proficiency serves two functions.\nFirst, it allows the character to pose convincingly\nas a beggar; success is automatic,\nso no proficiency check needs to\nbe made. This function is used most by\nAssassins, Bounty Hunters and Spies in\nthe pursuit of their assignments.\n\nA character can also use begging to\nprocure a very minimal daily income.\n(Many Cutpurses are in fact beggars\nwho aren\'t getting enough-and vice\nversa.) Success requires first that there\nbe people to beg from-people with\nmoney to give. A character in an abandoned\ncastle or a recently pillaged village\nare virtually assured of failure.\n\nThe following modifiers are suggested\nto the DM as guidelines. They do\nnot consider the wealth of a locale, just\nthe population density. Impoverished\nregions might have greater negative\nmodifiers-but then, so might affluent\nareas with traditions of stinginess.\nSuggested Begging Modifiers\nLocale          Mod\nuninhabited      X\nwilderness       X\ncountryside     -7\nhamlet/village  -5\ntown            -2\ncity             0\nIf a proficiency check is successful,\nthen a character is able to panhandle\nenough money, goods or services that\nday to meet his basic needs (a little food\nand drink, a place to sleep).\n\nThe DM may also use the proficiency\ncheck for specific single actions-e.g., a\ncharacter in disguise as a beggar accosts\na specific NPC.\n\nThe begging proficiency may not be\nused to force player characters to give\nmoney away: players are always free to\ndecide if and how generous their characters\nare in response to supplications
Boating: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Wis    Check Mod: +1\nA character with boating proficiency\nis needed to guide a boat down a rapid\nstream or to reduce the dangers of capsizing\na canoe or kayak. In addition, a\ncharacter with boating proficiency can\ninsure that a boat is propelled at its\nmaximum speed.\n\nNote that this proficiency is distinct\nfrom Navigation and Seamanship,\nwhich apply to ships on oceans, seas, or\nat least large lakes, rather than small\ncraft on smaller lakes and rivers.
Fast-Talking: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Cha    Check Mod: X\nFast-talk is the art of distraction and\nconning. If a successful proficiency\ncheck is made, the fast-talker is able to\nget away with whatever scam he is attempting.\nModifiers are based on the\nIntelligence and Wisdom of the target,\nas shown on Table 3. The DM may also\nintroduce modifiers according to the\ndifficulty or plausibility of what th\ncharacter is attempting\n\nTarg Int    Mod      Targ Wis    Mod\n    <3       NA           3       -5\n 4 - 5       -3       4 - 5       -3\n 6 - 8       -1       6 - 8       -1\n 9 - 12       0       9 - 12       0\n13 - 15      +1      13 - 15      +1\n16 - 17      +2      16 - 17      +3\n     18      +3           18      +5\n     19      +5          19+      NA\n     20      NA      \n\nModifiers are cumulative. Targets of\nIntelligence 3 or less are so dim that attempts\nto fast-talk them fail automatically\nbecause they can\'t follow what\'s\nbeing said. (Creatures that are so stupid\nare easy to fool in other ways, however.)\nTargets with Intelligence of 20 or\nmore or Wisdom of 19 or more are impervious\nto fast-talking.
Fortune Telling: \nSlots: 2    Relevant Ability: Cha    Check Mod: +2\nThis nonweapon proficiency covers\nknowledge of a variety of methods of\ndivination-all of them fake. The thief\nwith Fortune Telling is familiar with numerous\ndevices and methods, such as tarot\ncards, palm reading, interpreting the\nflight of sparrows or the arrangement of\na sacrificed animal's entrails, and so\nforth-or at least the thief is familiar\nenough with thee practices to make it\nappear that he's an authentic soothsayer.\n(If fortune telling can make accurate predictions\nin the DMs campaign, this proficiency\ndoes not necessarily enable the\nthief to do so; it confers no magical\npowers.) The thief makes up the predict-\nion he wishes to tell.\n\nA successful proficiency check indicates\nthat the thief's customer or client\nbelieves the fortune he was told to be\nauthentic. If the check fails, the sham is\ndiscovered in some way, or the prediction\nis simply not believed. If the DM\nwishes, the same modifiers described\nfor fast-talking (above) may be used,\nbased on the Intelligence and Wisdom\nof the subject and the believability of\nthe fortune predicted.\n\nOptional Rule: If a natural 1 (or another\nnumber secretly chosen by the\nDungeon Master before the die is\nrolled) comes up, the event that the\nthief predicted actually comes true!
Information Gathering: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Int    Check Mod: NA\nThis proficiency represents the ability\nto gather information from the underworld,\nmost commonly about\nroguish "jobs" and characters. A character\nwith this proficiency, in appropriate\ncircumstances, will be aware of any\nmajor rumors circulating among the\nlowlife of an area; and with a successful\nproficiency check, specific information\nabout a person or place can be gathered.\n(The DM must decide how specific\nthe information is.)\n\nThe following modifiers may adjust\nthe proficiency check:\n\nCharacters' reaction adjustments\n(based on Charisma) should benefit or\npenalize the roll, assuming contact with\npeople is involved in the search.\nThieves' guild members receive a bonus\nof +2, becaw they are assumed to\nhave more and better-informed contacts\nthan freelancers. Also, their "territory"\n(below) is considered to be that of\nthe guild, not just their own area of operation.\n\nSince this proficiency depends on a\nnetwork of informants and contacts,\nthe thief wiU be at a disadvantage trying\nto use it in an area other than his\nown territory. "Territory" refers to his\nregular base of operations-a town,\none neighborhood of a city, or even a\nwhole province or countryside. Outside\nthis territory the thief does not\nhear rumors automatically (a normal\nproficiency roll is required), and gathering\nspecific information suffers a penalty\nof at least -3. The DM may make\nit greater in truly foreign areas (e.g., a\nthief of Waterdeep trying to gather information\nin Calimshan), due to great\ndifferences in language, culture or race.\n\nFinally, any time a proficiency check\nis required for information gathering, a\nsmall investment of money for drinks,\nbribes, and so forth must be made, or\nan additional penalty of -3 is imposed.\nA total of ld10 gp is typical, and\nit is lost whether or not the desired information\nis found. (If the information\nis still unknown, the character can continue\nhis search the next day, spending\nmore money and making another proficiency\ncheck.) The DM is free to increase\nthe cost of using this proficiency\nif it suits the campaign.
Intimidation: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Special    Check Mod: Special\nThis is a talent for bending people to\nyour will by scaring the living daylights\nout of them. NPCs who are intimidated\nare quite likely to do what they're told,\nout of fear. On the negative side, they\nare also very likely to harbor much resentment\nagainst the character that intimidates\nthem. The NPCs will keep\ntheir resentment hidden-until the first\nchance to avenge their pride arises.\n\nIntimidation may be attempted with\none of two abilities: Strength or Charisma.\nIf Strength is used, the thief is\nthreatening immediate, personal bodily\nharm. If Charisma is used, the intimidation\nconsists of more subtle threats,\nwhich need not be physical. If successful,\nthe NPC is convinced that the thief\nis ready and capable of makii his life\nmiserable-if not immediately, then in\nthe near future.\n\nPlayer characters are never forced to\nsubmit to intimidation, as this would\ndetract from the players' freedom to\nrole-play.
Locksmithing: \n Slots: 1    Relevant Ability: Dex    Check Mod: 0\nThis is the specialized skill of making locks.\nIt is treated like other 'craft' proficiencies\nwhen checking for success. Also, theieves with\nthis proficiency gain a 10% bonus to their\nlockpicking skill, because they are intimately\nfamiliar with the internal structure and work-\ning of so many locks.\n\nBesides troubleshooters, dwarf and gnome\nthieves of any kit can take the locksmithing\nproficiency to fill one slot, because the\ntradition of crasftsmanship and mechanical\nthings in their cultural heritages.
Looting: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Dex    Check Mod: 0\nThis proficiency represents a knack\nfor grabbing the best loot in the shortest\ntime. For instance, a cat burglar breaks\ninto a room in a wealthy mansion. He\nhas about two minutes to fill his backpack,\nso that he can escape before\nguards are summoned by magical\nalarms. If his proficiency check succeeds,\nhe is able to recognize and stuff\ninto his pack the most valuable combination\nof items that is feasible, given his\nlimitations of time and space.
Observation: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Int    Check Mod: 0\nCharacters with this proficiency have\ncultivated exceptionally acute powers\nof observation. The DM may ask for a\nproficiency check (or secretly roll it\nhimself) anytime there is something\nsubtly askew; he may also allow characters\nwith observation to increase\ntheir chance of finding secret or concealed\ndoors by 1 in 6. The proficiency\ncovers all the senses.
Trailing: \nSlots: 1    Relevant Ability: Dex    Check Mod: Special\nTrailing resembles tracking, except\ntracking is associated chiefly with the\nwilderness, and trailing typically is\nused in major urban centers (i.e., cities\nand large towns). It is the talent of tailing\nsomeone-of keeping a certain die\ntance or even catching up to them,\nthough they may be attempting to\nblend into a crowd, or at least get lost in\nthe confusion of a street full of people.\n\nA proficiency check is first made to\nsee if the thief is able to trail without being\nnoticed. If the person followed has\nthe alertness proficiency, then the thief\nsuffers a -5 penalty.\n\nIf the thief is noticed, the person being\nfollowed may attempt to evade. To\nkeep from losing the trail, the thief must\nmake another proficiency check. A\nmodifier from -3 to +3 (vatying from\nfirst time in a foreign city to the thief's\nhome neighborhood) may be used, if\nthe DM so chooses, to reflect how well\nthe thief knows the area. Warn the\nplayer beforehand if you will apply\nmodifiers (though you needn't tell exactly\nwhat they are).\n\nThe DM should feel free to use situational\nmodifiers on these rolls. For example,\nif a street is relatively dear, the\nthief should get -1 or -2 on an attempt\nto follow unnoticed, but +1 or\n+ 2 if he has been seen and is chasing after\nhis subject. The opposite numbers\ncould be used for exceptionally\ncrowded situations, or at night.\nFor any Trailing proficiency roll, a\n-3 penalty applies if the person followed\nhas the Trailing proficiency as\nwell (and, presumably, knows better\nhow to foil the tricks of his own trade).
Voice Mimicry: \nSlots: 2    Relevant Ability: Cha    Check Mod: Special\nVoice mimicry is the art of convincingly\nimitating the voices of other people.\nIt is a very demanding skill, needing intensetraining\nofandpracticewith thevocal\ncords. For this reason it requires two\nnonweapon proficiency slots.\n\nA character with voice mimicry is\nable to imitate any accent he has heard.\nSuccess is automatic unless people who\nthemselves speak in that accent are his\nlisteners; in such a case, a proficiency\nroll is required (with a +2 modifier).\n\nMore difficult is the imitation of a specific\nperson's voice. To do this, the thief\nmust, of course, be familiar with the\nvoice. A proficiency check is needed to\ndetermine if the imitation is detected;\nmodifiers depend on how well the listeners\nknow the voice that is being mimicked.\nSuccess is of course certain if the\nlistener is a stranger, someone who has\nnever heard the original voice. To fool\nan acquaintance, there is no modifier;\nwhile fooling a friend of the subject is at\n- 2, a close friend - 5, and someone extremely\nclose (e.g., parent or spousesomeone\nwho has had close contact with\nthe person for years) is at - 7.\n\nThis ability is often used in conjunction\nwith the disguise proficiency.\nWhich proficiency must be checked\nfirst depends on whether the character\nis seen or heard. If the disguise first is\nsuccessful, there is a +5 modifier to the\nvoice mimicry-the listeners have already\naccepted the appearance, so they\nare less likely to doubt the voice. If the\ndisguise fails, it doesn't matter how\neood the voice imitation is. If the voice ~\nis successfully mimicked first, it gives a\n+1 modifier to the disguise check.
Acting: \nActing enables a character to skillfully portray\nvarious roles. Acting is most often used\nas a form of entertainment; it can also be useful\nin aiding a disguise. If both acting and disguise\nare known, the proficiency check for\neither is made with a +1 bonus.\nProficiency checks are required only if the\nactor must portray a particularly difficult\ncharacter or is attempting an \"ad lib\" role\n(i.e., a nonrehearsed role or on short notice).
Chanting: \nThe character is an accomplished chanter\nand can use this ability to help fellow workers\nor soldiers keep pace. Proficiency checks are\nused to determine the effectiveness of the\nchanting.\n\nOn a successful proficiency check, those\nwho can hear the chanter become slightly\nhypnotized by the rhythmic sound, causing\nthe time spent on arduous, repetitive tasks to\npass quickly. The DM can, at his option, adjust\nresults for forced marching, rowing, digging,\nand other such tasks accordingly.
Craft Instrument: \nThose who take this proficiency must specify\nwhether they are skilled at crafting wind,\nstringed, percussion, or keyboard instruments.\nIt takes an additional proficiency slot\nto gain one of the other skills. Three additional\nslots allow the character to take the title\n\"master craftsman\" as he is able to craft instruments\nof all forms.\n\nA craftsman must buy materials equal to a\nquarter of the instrument's sale value. It then\ntakes ld6 days to craft a wind or percussion\ninstrument, 2d8 days to form a stringed in-\nstrument, and 3d10 day to create a keyboard\ninstrument. These times assume that the\ncraftsman is spending 10 hours a day working\non the instrument. If craftsman tools (cost 25\ngp, weight 5 pounds) are not available, all\ntimes are doubled.\n\nThe quality of an instrument is determined\nby a final proficiency check. Failure results in\nan instrument of poor quality, while success\nindicates good quality. A natural 20 indicates\nthat the instrument is nonfunctional, while a\nnatural 1 results in a masterpiece worth twice\nthe normal value.\n\nSimple repairs take only ld4 hours and re-\nquire no proficiency check unless the proper\ntools are not available. However, repairing severe\ndamage requires Id8 hours and a check is\nmandatory for success.
Crowd Working: \nAlmost every bard is familiar with the ways\nof a crowd. However, those who take crowd\nworking learn all the tricks of the trade. Such\nbards are skilled at observing crowds and adjusting\ntheir performances accordingly.\n\nAny bard who is using a special ability to\nadjust the encounter reactions of a crowd\n(e.g., influence reactions) can make a crowd\nworking proficiency check. If this check is\nsuccessful, the bard can alter the reactions of\nthe crowd by two levels instead of the typical\none.\n\nIf the bard or his group is soliciting money\nfrom a crowd, a successful proficiency check\nindicates that the bard is particularly appealing\nand the crowd willingly donates twice as\nmuch money as it normally would (or conditions\nimprove one category if using the performance\nrules earlier in this handbook).
Poetry: \nProficiency in poetry includes the skills of\nreciting poetry and judging its quality. It also\nindicates that the character has a repertoire of\npoems memorized for recital at any time. No\nproficiency check is required for a normal\nrecital.\n\nIf the character can read and write, original\npoems can be written. A successful proficiency\ncheck indicates that the poem is of above\naverage quality.
Whitsling/Humming: \nAlmost anyone can whistle or hum. Those\nwho take this proficiency are exceptional\nwhistlers and hummers. They can produce\ntunes as captivating as most songs. A person\nwith this proficiency is a true master whistler\nand hummer.\n\nIt is so easy to learn a new tune to whistle or\nhum that characters with this proficiency can\nlearn numerous tunes. In fact, if a proficiency\ncheck is made, a whistler or hummer knows\nany particular tune in question. In addition, a\ncharacter with both this proficiency and the\nanimal lore proficiency can mimic any bird\ncall he has heard.\n\nHowever, most adventurers do not take\nwhistling just for the entertainment value. Instead,\nthey are looking for its uses in communication.\nThis communication is possible\nonly among those who know this proficiency.\nIf both characters succeed with their proficiency\nchecks, a single concept can be communicated.\nSome examples are \"Go around to the\nside door,\" \"I hear them coming,\" \"Slowly\nreach out now, the guard doesn't see you.\"
