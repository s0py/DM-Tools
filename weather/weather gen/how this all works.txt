to generate the weather, the 2weather.py program makes a csv file with all the basics.
this file only works for one combination of climate and terrain tho, so the "autoweather.py"
file runs the "2weather.py" program for all combinations.

but there is some extra info that needs to be added for use in the dm_tool.py program.
the easiest way for me to do this was to use the programming language "R" and the file
that handles that is also included. it combines info from the files that "autoweather.py"
will produce with info in the other .csv files in this directory and outputs .csv files
that the dm_tool.py program can use.

YOU SHOULD NEVER HAVE TO RUN THIS
